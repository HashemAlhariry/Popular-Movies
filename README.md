In this second and final stage, you will build a fully featured application that looks and feels natural on the latest Android operating system, adding functionality to the app you built in Stage 1:
Allow users to view and play trailers.
Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
Allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button star.
